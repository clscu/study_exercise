Input: Standard Input
Output: Standard Output
 

You are given n rods of length 1, 2бн, n. You have to pick any 3 of them & build a triangle. How many distinct triangles can you make? Note that, two triangles will be considered different if they have at least 1 pair of arms with different length.
 
Input
 
The input for each case will have only a single positive integer n (3<=n<=1000000). The end of input will be indicated by a case with n<3. This case should not be processed.
 
Output
 
For each test case, print the number of distinct triangles you can make.
